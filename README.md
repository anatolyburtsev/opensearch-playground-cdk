# Description
Repository is created to benchmark multithread search queries vs batch one for OpenSearch cluster.

**Spoiler**: Batch is much-much faster, use it.

### Experiment description
OpenSearch cluster has one index with big dataset described below.
Generate list of unique random ids and get corresponding documents using [Multisearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/multi-search/)
and regular [Search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/search/) in multiple threads. Number of threads I tried are:
1, 3, 6, 12, 25, 50, 100. Same list of randomly generated document ids was used.

I run several experiments for different numbers of documents to find: 100, 1000, 3000, 5000, 10000. MultiSearch was always faster.
The bigger was the number of experiments, the bigger gain MultiSearch has.



Note: Get operation would be faster than Query by id. Query is used intentionally to close recreate real use-case.
